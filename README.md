   A self taught inspiring front-end developer.
  <br>
  Journey started since January 19th 2021.

  Inside Projects repository are the works I have done with front-end mentor challenges
  <br>

  <i>My believe and my aim</i>
  <br>
  Write readable code first then talk about performance optimization.
  <br>
  However, standard for readable code is very subjective... :/
